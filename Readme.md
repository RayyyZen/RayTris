## Introduction

**RayTris** is a game I created in C using the `ncurses` library during my second year of preparatory engineering studies to enhance my programming skills. Inspired by the iconic game **Tetris**, it features a grid where various forms fall until they reach a solid surface. When a horizontal line is completed, it is cleared, and all the forms above it drop down by one row. The player's score increases based on the number of lines cleared simultaneously. The forms dropping speed increased each 30 seconds. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible while ensuring no blocks exceed the upper limit of the grid.

## Prerequisites

- **C compiler** such as `gcc` is required to compile the game.
- `ncurses` library to manage the game's terminal-based interface.

## Installation

1. **Install the `ncurses` library with the following command :** 
```sh
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libncurses5 libncursesw5
```

2. **Clone the repository :** 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RayyyZen/RayTris.git
```

3. **Move into the project folder :** 
```sh
cd RayTris
```

4. **Compile and run the project :**
```sh
make run
```
- **OR**
```sh
make && ./RayTris
```

### Gameplay :

A form appears at the top middle of the grid, and it can be moved using the keys shown in the "Game controls" section. Due to gravity, the form gradually falls until it hits a solid surface, and the process repeats until a block exceeds the top limit. In normal mode, after the game ends, the screen displays the top 3 players with the highest scores.
